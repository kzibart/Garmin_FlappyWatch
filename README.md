Garmin Connect IQ Game Flappy Watch

Flappy Watch!  A Flappy Bird clone for your watch!  And best of all, it's completely free!

Background:
The year is 2109.  You can't remember the last time you were strapped to a human arm.  The machines are planning one final coordinated attack.  All that remains is the installation of watches on the cybernetic arms so that the robots know when to advance.  But there's still hope!  A ragtag band of human infiltrators have upgraded the watches with the ability to flap!  If the watches can get past enough cyber arms without getting strapped on, the machine army won't be able to coordinate the attack, and the humans will have a fighting chance!  Can you do your part to save humanity!

Instructions:
Tap on the right to set the difficulty (distance between arms).
Tap on the left to start, and then tap anywhere to flap.
Keep tapping / flapping to navigate your way between the arms.
When you hit an arm, you get strapped to it and the game is over.

It's not perfect, and I'm sure it's a battery hog, but my daughter asked me to make Flappy Bird, so here you go.  Find my other Garmin apps, or leave me a tip, at this link:
